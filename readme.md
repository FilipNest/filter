# Filter (devname)

Discussion with context. Each post has some tags assigned to it, some are automatic, other are chosen, all can act as filters.

The filter box at the top can be used to add tags to the current context. Only messages with those tags will appear. Also, any message entered will get these tags automatically.

## Automatically added tags

* The userid of the author
* A unique id for the message itself
* Any tags from the current context

## Manually adding tags

Aside from changing the context, you can add extra tags by prefixing words with the `#` symbol.

## Navigating through a message

* Author will lead you to a filter for them. All their messages and any messages tagged with them will appear here.
* Reply button will add a filter for the message id
* Filter button will lead you to the filtered context of this message
* Any tags that aren't in the current context appear above the message preceded by a `+` sign.

## Points

Messages can be voted up or down (or both currently, not sure if bug/feature).

Eventually a special filter will allow people to filter messages by how many points they have.
